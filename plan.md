# 12 Week Year C++ project

What this program should do, at minimum:

- Let the user write one goal for one day.
- choose one (yearly) tactic for that goal.
- choose the desired daily score for the tactic
- choose the daily score for the tactic 
- calculate the daily score (score/desired_score)
- save and retrieve all this info

objects:
- Goal: attributes: name, tactic 
        methods: give name, tactic

- Tactic: attributes: name, desired_score

- Day: attributes: Date, Tactic, score



As this is a quite complex program compared to what I'm used to, I will start by getting
the most simple version of the program to work, and then add functionalities as I go along.
The first program only has a 1 day year, with 1 goal and 1 tactic for that day. 

I learned how to do the most basic reading and writing from and to a file, and so I can load 
past data whenever I start the program. 

Now It's time to polish the basic version as far as possible, and after that begin adding some more
features, like many tactics for a goal, 7 day weeks and 12 week years.
